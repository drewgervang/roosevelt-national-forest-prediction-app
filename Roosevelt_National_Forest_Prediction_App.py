    This project helps identify which types of trees grow in different areas of Roosevelt National Forest using a machine learning algorithm called CatBoost. Using topographic data such as elevation, slope, proximity to water sources, past fires, and roadways, as well as light availability and wilderness area designations, the model predicts which of 7 forest types is found in any given 30m x 30m patch of land. The problem is ecologically important because different tree species create distinct habitats that support diverse wildlife communities, making forest type prediction crucial for conservation and management efforts.
    
    The project serves dual purposes: scientific and educational. Scientifically, the model achieves strong performance (83% F1-macro score) with acceptable generalization capabilities (10% train-test gap), making it potentially suitable for ecological research applications. Additionally, it reduced the feature set from 54 to 11 and eliminated the need for the 40 soil type features in the original dataset. With the full dataset, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost were tried. CatBoost outperformed every other model besides LightGBM, which had significant overfitting issues even after regularization efforts so it wasn't used for this project. When comparing simplified models, two versions of CatBoost were tested: the first achieved 80.5% F1-macro score with a 6.8% performance difference between training and testing, while the second achieved 83.0% F1-macro with a 10% difference. The second model was chosen for this website because it performed better on new data for every class even if it had a larger test/performance gap, but both versions are available in the GitHub repository. Educationally, the interactive web application allows users to explore machine learning predictions in real-time, visualize relationships between environmental variables and forest distributions, and gain insights into forest ecology through hands-on interaction with the model.
    
    The model and dataset are specifically based on Roosevelt National Forest in northern Colorado. Therefore, the predictions are tailored to this study area's unique environmental conditions and may not generalize to other geographic regions with different climatic patterns or topography. This regional specificity makes the model particularly valuable for local forest management decisions while serving as an educational case study for understanding how environmental factors influence forest cover types in Roosevelt National Forest.

    **1. Spruce/Fir**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 2,525-3,675m  
    Typically found at higher elevations in cool, moist environments. These subalpine areas experience cold temperatures year-round with heavy snowfall that often remains on the ground well into summer.
    
    **2. Lodgepole Pine**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 2,169-3,413m  
    Their serotinous cones are adapted so that their sealing resin melts during a fire. These seeds are then in ideal conditions for germination with a bright open canopy and clear forest floor.
    
    **3. Ponderosa Pine**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 1,903-2,850m  
    Mature trees have thick, fire-resistant bark, open crowns, and self-pruning limbs that reduce fire damage.
    
    **4. Cottonwood/Willow**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 1,989-2,526m  
    Both species are found along rivers and streams where broken branches can go downriver and form the roots of new trees.

    **5. Aspen**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 2,482-3,007m  
    Deciduous trees known for their vibrant fall colors grow in large clonal colonies connected by shared root systems, making each grove a single organism. A pioneer species that quickly colonizes burned areas, but also requires abundant sunshine.
    
    **6. Douglas-fir**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 1,863-2,883m  
    Adaptable to diverse climates from coastal maritime conditions to harsh mountain environments. Important timber tree and is grown as a Christmas tree. Douglas-fir adapts to different slope aspects based on sunlight and moisture availability. Though the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are also versatile they are only found within the Rocky Mountains.
    
    **7. Krummholz**  
    üèîÔ∏è Elevation: 2,870-3,849m  
    At alpine elevations, harsh conditions including strong winds and ice cause trees to grow in twisted, wind-sculpted forms known as krummholz.
